Mobile App Introduction:

This is an IOS Mobile App to enable safety about decision-making. Your can get first a route direction powered by Google Map API. Then You can invite your friends to become your companions, which means they can monitor your location in real-time. Once you feel nervous on your way to somewhere, you can sent for help during anytime you using the app, through sending alert message to your companions or call police directly. The creative point that your phone can detect your motion automatically. If you shake your phone accidentally on intentionally, your phone will pop up an alert view on that there is a 15 seconds counter down. If you confirm your safe during the time, nothing happened, but if you don't respond, your app will send directly "you are in danger" message to your companions. 

Your companions can access your start location, destination, route, transportation mode and real-time location by typing correctly your username and accesscode that you sent to them. They can also obtain your time and distance rest to your location.
